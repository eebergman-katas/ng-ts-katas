Spy
Captures the inputs of a func.
Captures by wrapping
Assert on the spy with something public usualy from a framework
how many times it was called

Stub
Forces a certain return value
  -Guac example we may be testing the method that makes all of the 
    ingredients for guac but in the test all we care is that guac is returned 
    to us. Stub only returns the guac

Helps force logic down a certain path

Mock 
Has a return like a Stub
has assertions like a spy

Fake Obj
Lightweight implmentation of a real thing
No assertions nor control points
Make it act like the real obj but without dependencies 
  nor crossing a boundary like the internet or writting to a file

Speeds up running a test
